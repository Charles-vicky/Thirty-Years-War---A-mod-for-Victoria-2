EVTOPTA55;Make it a primice!;x;
EVTOPTB55;Censure it!;x;
EVTNAME56;Circulation Doubles!;x;
EVTDESC56;Having a free press means having to deal with the strangest things. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Watchman, a queer little tabloid that sees a fair amount of circulation in one of our states, has published an opinion-piece painting the Foreign Minister out to be a member of a Secret Masonic Sect. While this isn't outside the normal scope of this low-brow nonsense paper, this particular piece of bad writing has recived more attention than usual. People, for one reason or another, actually seem to belive these accusations. Denying the rumors will be seen by the literate upper classes as a giving-in to plebianism, but not denying the rumors will cause said lower-classes to actually believe in them.;x;
EVTOPTA56;Do not deny the rumors;x;
EVTOPTB56;Deny the rumors;x;
EVTOPTC56;But I saw him at the lodge last week...?;x;

EVTNAME60;The Integration!;x;

EVTNAME63;The Germans Ask For Buy Venezuela!;x;
EVTDESC63;In a surprising diplomatic move, Germany has proposed purchasing the Venezuelan territory, formerly known as Klein-Venedig, from Spain. This offer presents a difficult choice: relinquish control over a valuable colonial asset in exchange for significant financial compensation, or reject the offer and maintain Spains presence in the Americas. The decision could shift the balance of power in the region and alter Spain's colonial future.;x;
EVTOPTA63;Ok, we need money...;x;
EVTOPTB63;NO! How do you kind considere that offer?;x;
EVTNAME64;The Flames of Civil War Ignite;x;
EVTDESC64;England stands at the crossroads of destiny, torn between the divine right of kings and the rising power of the people. The crack of musket fire signals the dawn of a new age, where the banners of King Charles I flutter against the winds of rebellion, and the impassioned voice of Oliver Cromwell calls for liberty and justice. This war is not merely a struggle for the crownit is the battle for the soul of England, where brother fights brother, and the fate of a nation hangs in the balance.;x;
EVTOPTA64;Long live the mancomunity of Cromwell!;x;
EVTOPTB64;We stand with the monarchy!;x;

EVTNAME66;The End of the Holy Roman Empire;x;
EVTDESC66;After nearly a thousand years, the Holy Roman Empirea patchwork of duchies, kingdoms, and free citiesfinally crumbles. Once a symbol of imperial unity and Christian authority, the empire has been weakened by constant warfare, internal divisions, and the rise of powerful nation-states. With Napoleon's campaigns and the growing ambitions of Europes great powers, the empires ancient institutions are dismantled, and the last emperor relinquishes his crown. The dissolution marks the end of an era where emperors, electors, and princes once reigned over the heart of Europe. In its place, new nations and empires rise from the ashes, eager to fill the vacuum left by the fall of this once-great entity. The echoes of the Holy Roman Empire may linger, but its reign over Europe has come to a final, irrevocable end.;x;
EVTOPTA66;Oh...;x;

EVTNAME68;The Fall of Cromwell's Protectorate;x;
EVTDESC68;After years of rule under the iron hand of Oliver Cromwell, England stands at a crossroads once more. The dream of a republic, born from the ashes of civil war, has begun to fade as the Protectorate crumbles under political instability, public unrest, and the absence of Cromwell's leadership following his death. The once-powerful Commonwealth now falters, unable to hold the factions together. In 1660, the monarchy is restored under Charles II, marking the end of Englands brief experiment with republican rule. The fall of Cromwells regime signals the return of royal authority and the restoration of the Stuart dynasty, as the country looks back on years of upheaval and looks forward to an uncertain future under its restored king.;x;
EVTOPTA68;Long live the King!;x;
EVTNAME69;The Triumphant Dawn of the Stuarts;x;
EVTDESC69;The sun rises over England, casting its golden light upon a land united under the victorious banner of the Stuarts. After years of bloodshed and turmoil, the rightful monarchs have reclaimed their throne, their divine right affirmed by God and the strength of their loyal subjects. Bells toll across the kingdom, from the rugged hills of Scotland to the green fields of England, heralding a new era of peace and prosperity. King Charles I, resplendent in royal regalia, is once again seated upon his throne, his reign now more glorious and absolute than ever. The scars of war fade as the realm rejoices, the people embracing their king, their savior, with open hearts. The crown gleams brighter than ever before, and the Stuarts rise like phoenixes, eternal and unbroken. A golden age dawns for Englandone of order, loyalty, and the divine grace of monarchy.;x;
EVTOPTA69;God save the King!;x;
EVTNAME70;The Rebellion of the Cromwellian Colonies;x;
EVTDESC70;Far across the seas, in the untamed lands of North America, the flame of Cromwell's legacy refuses to die. The colonies, once loyal to the ideals of republicanism and liberty, rise in defiance of the restored Stuart monarchy. Stirred by memories of Cromwell's rule and emboldened by the distant echoes of freedom, the colonists declare their intent to break free from the tyranny of the crown. What began as whispers of dissent now roars like wildfire through the colonies, as towns and settlements rally under the banner of republicanism. The struggle between the old world of monarchs and the new world of liberty has begun, and the fate of these distant lands will once again be written in the blood of revolution. The spirit of Cromwell lives on, and the colonies will stop at nothing to forge their own destiny.;x;
EVTOPTA70;Fuck them!;x;
EVTNAME71;The Spark of the Hyde Conspiracy;x;
EVTDESC71;Whispers spread through the streets of London and beyond, as Edward Hydes intricate web of intrigue begins to unfold. Key royalists secretly rally to the cause, and the first embers of rebellion are ignited. What started as a quiet plot now threatens to erupt into full-scale conflict, as the supporters of the Stuart dynasty prepare to strike back against their oppressors. The time for restoration is upon themthe kingdom holds its breath for what is to come;x;
EVTOPTA71;Great! God save the King!;x;
EVTNAME72;The Republic Triumph;x;
EVTDESC72;The liberty won. Today the opressors look crestfallen at the floor, instead Cromwell's faction. The war is over. "The Liberty Won!"-The pepole shouted-. There's gonna be dificult times for England, but, the English pepole got their objective...;x;
EVTOPTA72;Long Live the Mancomunity!;x;
EVTNAME73;The Monarchist Triumph!;x;
EVTDESC73;Today, a bad day for the freedom...In the France, the monarchists gang of Louis XIV destroyed the revolution of le Fronde. "The winners write the history"-Thomas Hobbes. Now all the revolutionaries are in the statal prisions under a exhaustive vigilance.;x;
EVTOPTA73;Long live the King!;x;
EVTNAME74;The Revolutionary Triumph!;x;
EVTDESC74;Today, a bad day for the absolutism...In the France, the revolutionaries winned the battle, an important step for the next generation revolutionaries. The French expansionism is exagerated in this Faction, so, it's probably that this revolutionaries want to extend their revolution and the French culture to other regions. Could be te correct word is "impose" and not "extend"...;x;
EVTOPTA74;Long Live the Fronde, Hurra!!;x;
EVTNAME75;Louis XIV Decapitation;x;
